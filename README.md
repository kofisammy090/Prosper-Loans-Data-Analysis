# Reflection
In this project, the selected dataset is from Prosper Loans. Prosper or Prosper Marketplace Inc. is a San Francisco, California based company specializing in loans at low interest rates to the borrowers. The dataset consists of 81 variables and 113,937 observations. With the aid of the detailed descriptions and definitions, I was able to decode the meaning of each variable and get insight of the dataset. For this project my focus was on the relationship between loan amount, borrower apr, borrower rating and prosper rating.

The next step is to get to know each of the variables. For individual variables, histogram, boxplot and countplot are a good way to show their distribution but in this project I used histogram and countplot only.

After getting some ideas of individual variable, we can move to next step and start to explore the relations among variables, especially those concerning the feature of interest. This can represented by using different types of plot such as regplot, scatter plot, box plot, countplot and others to show the relations between two variables. In this project, I made use of reg plot to show the relations between loan term and loan amount, and the relation between loan amount and borrower apr.

For multi variables, the best option was point plot to show the relation between the variables.

# Summary Findings
This exploration of Prosper loan data was aimed at identifying the relationship between the features of interest. That's the factors affecting the loan accessbility. After the analysis,came with follwing the findings;

For the loan amount, we noticed the loan amount determines the months given to repay the loan. The higher the amount the higher the loan term given.

The borrower Apr shows a negative relationship between prosper rating and loan amount. As borrower apr decreases the loan amount and loan term increases.

# Limitation
The dataset had many missing records. After removing the missing records, I had a good number of data left for the analysis but there will still be some degree of concerns on how well we can generalize the conclusions obtained in our analysis.
